# ðŸ§°Â Toolbox Repo README

This repo contains the following folders 

- `clustering`
- `package_install`
- `quality of life`

Each folder contains a README describing the contents and an R file. The R file contains functions is meant to be sourced into your .RMD or .ipynb. For example

```r
source("/Users/alexanderfoote/dev/scRNAseq_toolbox.R")

```

Once sourced, you can call the functions just like you would with any standard R package. If you're curious about how a function works, you can view its code by typing the function name (without parentheses) and running the code chunk.
